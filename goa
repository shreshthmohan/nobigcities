How is the internet across Goa? In places of South Goa like Palolem where there's less crowd than other places?

4G isn't great in a lot of places where you'd want to go. Jio has the best coverage. Most cafes, beach shacks have internet, but it's not always reliable or fast enough. There are places with good internet though. Mayur's place for example. I'm not completely sure about South Goa, most of my experience has been in North Goa.
