I am in Dharamshala from the last 2 months. It's a lovely place - lots of greenery and not too touristy. I would suggest Dharamshala or Manali

@Gokul Kailasam which hostel?

Gokul Kailasam  2 months ago
Hey @nivesh not in a hostel, staying in a fully-furnished 2 BHK. Referred by one of my friends who is living in Dharamshala. We have hired a maid who cooks, cleans, and washes clothes. And we have got Vayudoot internet that gets 50 mpbs speed. Looking to stay in Dharamshala?

I was there in Zostel Vagamon some days ago. The wifi over there was too unstable. I got a good JIO network though.


Any recommendations for places to work in any hill stations in tamilnadu ? I’m not comfortable to work from bed, So shared common workspace is preferred.

Ooty and Kodai are the big 2. Maybe do a quick search for co working spaces there?

Balaji Shanmugavel  2 months ago
@Sudharshan I have searched and i couldn’t find a coworking space in both of the places.  I guess i will have to choose north india or kerala then.

@Balaji Shanmugavel Are there co-working spaces in any of Kerala's hill-stations?

Balaji Shanmugavel  2 months ago
I just found out that Zostel in Kodaikanal and Vagamon have a common area that we can use to work.

@Yash Jaiswal are you currently travelling?

@GaneshMani No. Not at this moment. (edited)

Have stayed in the property neighbouring the Zostel at Vagamon. It is ridiculously remote and not really conducive to working.

JIO works but you really cannot get a stable internet connection there. I had trouble doing regular phone calls.

Yash Jaiswal  2 months ago
@cruise I think I second you on that. I am not sure if Vagamon is entirely good enough to work from.

Thanks for the heads up @Yash Jaiswal @cruise

Coonoor is a nice place to checkout. More quaint and hep than Ooty.

cruise:fire:  1 month ago
I agree. Also, Coonoor has good broadband coverage. There’s a few optic fiber providers as well…

@cruise that's awesome. suggest some places bro if you have any

cruise:fire:  1 month ago
Unfortunately no dude. I worked out of the Neemrana Heritage hotel in Coonoor when we were vacationing there… I’m honestly not sure about zostel like facilities there.. But it should exist. OR, worst case, you can get a house for rent like super duper cheap…

@cruise naaice. Didn’t know Neemrana was in Coonoor as well.

Has anyone worked from varkala ? I assume that internet will be stable there since it is not a remote place compared to hill stations. am i right?
