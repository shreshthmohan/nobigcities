Internet connectivity:

Leh and the surrounding villages have good 4G connectivity (But since it's a part of J&K, govt censorship might be a problem)
Even Diskit in Nubra has Jio 4G and Lamayuru. Jio 4G postpaid. Or local prepaid connection.

Long-term stay options:
Barebones rooms in Leh and Choglamsar for Rs 1000
Guesthoues: 10k / month

Staying over winter: use electric heaters like the locals do.

Reliability of electricity: 
Winter will have frequent power cuts as they don't have enough water for the hydroelectric power plant
Summers are fine.

Availability of pre-owned bicycles and feasibility of using them to move around?
There are a few bicycle shops in Leh. You can ask them if they sell the old bikes.
